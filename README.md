<h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
<p> A series of webinars launched to make the best use of technology and time during this pandemic. It conducts webinars every Sunday, focusing on different programming languages and many more by the students.
The series has been started with an exceptionally small idea of sharing knowledge with everyone around the globe, and with â€˜Season 2â€™ we are getting closer to that milestone.
The webinar started with the fundamental concepts of AI/ML along with Python and towards the end,giving knowledge and skills of this domain. Through this webinar, the students were able to solve a linear regression problem using Python and ML concepts. </p> 

<h3>LEARNING OUTCOMES </h3> 

<p> Students  benefited from using AI/ML technology to make some learning tasks easier. AI/ML in education enables schools and colleges to carve out personalized learning experiences for their students. Python offers concise and readable code. While complex algorithms and versatile workflows stand behind machine learning and AI, Pythonâ€™s simplicity allows developers to write reliable systems.

In this session the We get to Learn:
Fundamental concepts of AI/ML
Machine learning algorithms
Related terminologies (like deep learning, neural networks, etc.) </P>
